# Overview
This repository contains SQL queries used to analyze global COVID-19 data by comparing case and death rates, identifying trends, and preparing data for visualization.

# Data Sources
Data was sourced from [Alex the Analyst Portfolio Projects on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/tree/main).

# Project Structure
### SQL Queries: [Queried and analyzed COVID-19 data](https://github.com/dianejchang/Covid-Cases/blob/main/Covid-Cases.sql) in PostgreSQL
1. Create tables
2. Compare Total Cases vs Total Deaths
3. Compare Total Cases vs Population
4. Identifying countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population
5. Identifying countries with the highest death count per population
6. Breaking down continents with the highest death count per population
7. Showcasing global numbers of total cases, deaths, and percentage
8. Comparing total population vs vaccinations
9. Using a Common Table Expression to calculate partition from the previous query
10. Using a temp table to calculate partition from the previous 2 queries
11. Creating view to store data for visualization

### Tableau Visualizations: [Created a dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diane.chang/viz/Covid_17143271385660/Dashboard1) highlighting global statistics.
